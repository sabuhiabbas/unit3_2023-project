<i>Ski / Snowboard Rental</i>
</p>

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
<p align="justify">
Oswell Taiga Sakaguchi runs a ski and snowboard rental shop called "Fly Skis" in Karuizawa. They offer skis, snowboards, shoes, and clothes for rent to customers visiting the area for skiing or snowboarding. Fly Skis is known for having the best equipment, which has been great for Mr. Sakaguchi's business.
However, this has also created problems for his employees. They have recently expressed their frustration about the lack of a system to keep track of the equipment that has been rented out. This makes it difficult for them to help customers when they return the equipment, as they need to search for the receipt and confirm that all items have been returned. Some workers have even threatened to quit if the situation is not resolved.
</p>

## Proposed Solution
### Design Statement
<p align="justify">
To solve the issue of keeping track of equipment rented out at Fly Skis, a custom application can be developed using the Python programming language and the Kivy MD library for the user interface design. The choice of Python was made for several reasons, including its ease of use, large community, and wide range of libraries. It is also available on all software systems. The Kivy MD library was chosen because it provides a material design look and feel for the user interface, making it intuitive and easy to use for employees.
The data for the rental transactions will be stored using SQL. SQL is a very strong and versatile database management system. It is perfect for this kind of application because it can handle a lot of data, keep it safe with its security features, and support multiple people using it at the same time. It's really amazing what SQL can do! By using SQL to store the rental information, Fly Skis will have a robust and scalable solution for managing their equipment rentals.
With this proposed solution, Fly Skis will have a centralized, easy-to-use system for tracking equipment rentals, improving the efficiency of the rental process, and reducing frustration among employees.

### Rationale for Proposed Solution
Python is a versatile language and can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. This versatility makes it a good choice for building a wide range of applications, including custom software.[^1]
Python has a large and active community of users and developers. This means that there is a wealth of resources available to help you learn the language and build your application, as well as a large pool of talented developers who can contribute to your project.[^2]
Python has a simple, intuitive syntax that makes it easy for new users to learn and for experienced developers to quickly pick up. This makes it a good choice for building applications quickly and with fewer bugs, as well as for prototyping new ideas.[^3]

One of the main advantages of using KivyMD is that it allows developers to build applications that can run on multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and Windows. This makes it an ideal choice for those who want to reach a wide audience with their apps. KivyMD is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for developers of all skill levels to get started with creating their own applications. This can help to save time and effort, allowing developers to focus on creating their app's functionality and features. KivyMD offers a wide range of customization options that allow developers to tailor their apps to meet the specific needs of their users. From changing the look and feel of the interface to adding custom animations, the library offers a variety of options to make an app truly unique.[^4]

SQL is designed to handle large amounts of data efficiently, making it an ideal choice for applications that need to store and manage a large amount of information. This makes it an ideal choice for applications that need to scale as they grow, as SQL databases can be easily expanded to meet the needs of the application. SQL databases allow for the storage of structured data, which can be easily queried and manipulated. This makes it easier to find the information you need, and to perform complex data analysis tasks. SQL databases are highly reliable, and offer features such as transaction management and data integrity to ensure that the data stored in the database remains accurate and up-to-date. This makes SQL an ideal choice for applications that need to store critical data that must be maintained even in the event of a power outage or other failure.[^5]

### Success Criteria
1. The solution validates the input for items to rent, so the datatable is well-organized.
2. The application features a secure login system, enabling the user to protect their data. 
3. The user can enter various information (Customer ID, Date, Item type, Size, Item ID) relating to the rental equipment. 
4. The user can delete an equipment records when returned. 
5. The solution hashes the signup information entered by the user when trying to sign up.
6. The user can see all the borrowed items in a table.

# Criteria B: Design

## System Diagram
![System diagram for skisnowboard rental shop tracker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111758436/218088249-14279bc6-a1fe-40fd-98bb-fd0d3174b344.png)
<i>Figure 1</i> - The system diagram for the application is illustrated in Figure 1. The development of the program is achieved through the use of PyCharm and the KivyMD library. Data is stored in unit3_project_database.db, which is facilitated by the SQLite database engine. The arrows in the diagram indicate the flow of data between the various components of the application.[^16]

## Wireframe
![unit3_project_wireframe (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111758436/218105085-c54acaf6-3e25-42ba-a799-c51b652a95ae.png)
<i>Figure 2</i> - The wireframe for the user interface is depicted in Figure 2. Upon launching the application, the user is welcomed with a login page. After successful login, the user is redirected to the homepage, where they can navigate to various pages through the buttons provided. Pressing the "Sign up" button on the login page takes the user to the sign-up page.

The homepage provides the user with four buttons, namely "new item," "borrowed items list," "log out," and "return item." Clicking on the "new item" button leads the user to the new item page where they can fill out a form to add a new item. Once the form is completed, the user can either press "save" to proceed to the thank you page or "cancel" to go back to the homepage.

The "borrowed items list" button on the homepage takes the user to a page where they can view a list of borrowed equipment. From this page, the user can go back to the homepage by clicking on the "home" button.

In the sign-up page, the user can either press "register" to complete the registration process or "login" to go back to the login page.

In the thank you page, the user is given the option to either go back to the homepage or view the list of borrowed items. Overall, the user interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks.[^17]

## Flow diagram
### Flow diagram for create_table (database_handler_login_signup class)
![create_table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111758436/223089660-e5c17f9a-dcd4-47d1-af44-1da7bfb9e726.jpeg)
<i>Figure 3</i> - The flow diagram for the create_table method of the database_handler_login_signup class is shown in Figure 3. This method is used to create a table with the name "users" that contains four columns, namely email, username, password, and user_type. This table is created only when the program is run for the first time, and if the table already exists, the method does not create a new table. The create_table method is an essential part of the database_handler_login_signup class as it sets up the necessary table for the program to function correctly.[^19]

### Flow diagram for try_login (LoginScreen class)
![flowchart_try_login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111758436/223086624-3710e2b7-e578-49c3-a7e0-57b8c11a8c8b.jpeg)
<i>Figure 4</i> - The try_login method of the LoginScreen class is used to authenticate the user's login credentials. It takes in the user's email and password as input, and then retrieves the hashed password from the "users" table in the database using the get_password_from_email() method from the database_handler_login_signup class. The try_login method is a crucial part of the LoginScreen class as it ensures that only authorized users are granted access to the application's features.[^19]

### Flow diagram for on_pre_enter (BorrowedItemsScreen class)
![on_pre_enter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111758436/223086666-866c604d-aa3d-4974-8d3e-1528603271f5.jpeg)
<i>Figure 5</i> - The on_pre_enter method of the BorrowedItemsScreen class is a crucial function that is triggered when the user clicks the "BorrowedItemsScreen" button to view a list of borrowed items. As demonstrated in Figure 5, this method updates the displayed table each time it is run to ensure that the user is presented with the most current information from the database. on_pre_enter method of the BorrowedItemsScreen class is instrumental in providing the user with a smooth and up-to-date experience when interacting with the application.[^19]

## ER Diagram
![ER_diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111758436/221069445-e499566c-0956-4678-8704-b0b00b32315d.jpg)
<i>Figure 6</i> - The ER diagram for the database used by the application is shown in Figure 6. The database consists of two tables, "users" and "items". The "users" table, which is located on the left side of the diagram, stores the user information, including their username, email, and password.

On the right side of the diagram, the "items" table is shown. This table is used to store data related to borrowed items, such as customer ID, date, kind, size, and item ID. Each item in the table is assigned a unique item ID to prevent a single item from being lent out to multiple customers simultaneously.[^18]

## UML Diagram
![unit3_UML](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111758436/223052312-413a2b18-9106-4f09-a53c-9e78993b4ad1.jpeg)
<i>Figure 7</i> - The UML diagram in Figure 7 illustrates the class hierarchy used in the application. All classes are designed to inherit from the main class MDApp and MDClasses. This inheritance hierarchy is shown in the diagram, which clearly illustrates the relationships between the various classes and their properties.

In the diagram, each class is represented by a rectangle containing the class name, attributes, and methods. Arrows between the classes denote inheritance relationships, with child classes located beneath their parent classes.[^19]

## List of techniques used

1. If-else statements: These are conditional statements that allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions. If a condition is true, a certain block of code is executed, otherwise, another block of code is executed.[^6]
2. Loops: These are used to repeat a certain block of code multiple times. There are different types of loops, such as for loops, while loops, and do-while loops.[^7]
3. Functions: These are reusable blocks of code that can be called multiple times from different parts of a program. Functions usually take inputs, perform some operations on those inputs, and then return a result.[^8]
4. Variables: These are containers for storing data values in a program. Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, or boolean values.[^9]
5. Arrays: These are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Arrays can be of different types, such as one-dimensional arrays or multi-dimensional arrays.[^10]
6. Objects: These are complex data types that store data and methods related to a particular object or entity. Objects are typically used in object-oriented programming.[^11]
7. Classes: These are templates for creating objects in object-oriented programming. A class defines the properties and behaviors of an object, and objects can be created from a class.[^12]
8. Inheritance: This is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.[^13]
9. Polymorphism: This is another feature of object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class, by using common interfaces or abstract classes.[^14]
10. Recursion: This is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. Recursion is used in many algorithms, such as sorting and searching.[^15]

## Development
### Success criteria 1: The solution validates the input for items to rent, so the datatable is well-organized
In order to ensure a well-organized structure for the item details in the table, validation for each input is necessary. This approach provides a systematic way of organizing the data and ensures that only valid inputs are stored in the table.
#### Validating
```.py
def validate_date(self, text):
    """
    Validate the entered date
    """
    # Check if the entered text is a valid date in the specified format
    try:
        datetime.strptime(text, self.input_format)
        print("Valid date entered!")
    except ValueError:
        self.ids.date.error = True.
```
The code above illustrates the method used to validate input fields. This validation structure is implemented for each text field in the application to ensure data accuracy and consistency.[^8]

#### Inserting values to database
```.py
def insert(self, email, username, password):
    query = f"INSERT into users (email, password, username) VALUES ('{email}', '{password}', '{username}')"
    self.run_query(query)
```
The code shown above demonstrates how to insert new user data into the database. This same structure is also applied when I need to insert a new item into the database.

#### Show password method
```.py
# Define a method that toggles the visibility of the password field
def toggle_show_password(self):
    # Invert the value of the show_password attribute
    self.show_password = not self.show_password
    # Set the password attribute of the password field to the opposite of the show_password attribute
    self.ids.passwd_in.password = not self.show_password
```
The code defines a method that allows for the visibility of the password field to be toggled. This helped me to make it easier for the user to avoid human errors when entering their password on the login screen. When called, the method inverts the value of the show_password attribute and sets the password attribute of the password field to the opposite of the show_password attribute.

### Success criteria 2: The application features a secure login system, enabling the user to protect their data
The login system provides a secure way for users to access the application, protecting the data they enter and store in the application's database. Users can log in whenever they need to use the application, ensuring the safety and confidentiality of their information.
#### KivyMD Text field
```.kv
MDTextField:
    id: email_in
    hint_text: "Enter your email"
    icon_left: "email"
    helper_text_mode: "on_error"
    helper_text: "Please enter email"
```
This piece of code shows the use of KivyMD to create a text field for obtaining user input. The text field includes a hint text to indicate the expected input, an icon on the left side to signify the type of input, and a helper text that appears in case of an error. This structure is used throughout the development of my solution for user inputs (eg. Adding new item to the database, which is the 3rd success criteria for the user).[^20]
#### KivyMD Button
```.kv
MDRaisedButton:
    font_name: "avenir_regular.ttf"
    id: login
    text: "Login"
    on_press: root.try_login()
    size_hint: .3, .5
    md_bg_color: "#689ebd"
```
The code above demonstrates how a button is created and utilized to obtain a command from the user via KivyMD. This structure is implemented throughout the code to obtain commands from the user in different places of my code.[^21]

### Success criteria 4: The user can delete an equipment records when returned
#### Deleting a row from the table
```.py
def delete(self):
    # Function to delete checked rows in the table
    checked_rows = self.data_table.get_row_checks() # Get the checked rows
    print(checked_rows)
    # delete
    db = database_handler_items("unit3_project_database.db")
    for r in checked_rows:
        item_id = r[4]  # use item_id instead of id
        print(item_id)
        query = f"delete from items where item_id = {item_id}"  # use item_id instead of id
        print(query)
        db.run_save(query)
        # Create and open the alert dialog to confirm item has been deleted
        dialog = MDDialog(title="Thank you, item deleted!",
                          text=f"Your item ID: {item_id} has been successfully deleted.")
        dialog.open()
    db.close()
    self.update()
```
The above code shows how to delete checked rows from a table in the database. The code accesses the checked rows using the get_row_checks() function, deletes them using a loop and a delete query. The code also uses the MDDialog function to create an alert dialog to inform the user that the item has been deleted. This structure is used in other areas of the code to display pop-up dialogs.[^22]

### Success criteria 5: The solution hashes the signup information entered by the user when trying to sign up
#### Hashing a string
```.py
from passlib.context import CryptContext

pwd_config = CryptContext(schemes=["pbkdf2_sha256"],
                          default="pbkdf2_sha256",
                          pbkdf2_sha256__default_rounds=30000
                          )

# Function to hash a password
def hash_password(user_password):
    return pwd_config.hash(user_password)

# Function to check if a password matches a hash
def check_password(hashed_password, user_password):
    return pwd_config.verify(user_password, hashed_password)
```
The above code demonstrates how to hash a string using the passlib library. The hash_password() function takes a user password as an input and returns the hashed password. The check_password() function is used to verify whether a user-entered password matches the hashed password stored in the database during the login process. These functions ensure that passwords are securely stored in the database and cannot be accessed by unauthorized users.[^23]

### Password policy
```.py
pattern = r'^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[!@#$%^&*()_+]).{8,}$'

# Check if the password matches the pattern
if not re.match(pattern, passwd1):
    self.ids.e_passwd.error = True
    dialog = MDDialog(title="Password doesn't meet the requirements",
                      text="The password entered must be:\n- At least 8 characters,\n- One capital letter,\n- One lowercase letter,\n- One symbol: !@#$%^&*()_+")
    dialog.open()
    return
```
<p>This code block checks whether the user's password meets the minimum requirements, before allowing them to sign up. The regular expression pattern enforces that the password must be at least 8 characters long, contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character from the set !@#$%^&*()_+. If the password does not match the pattern, an error message is displayed to the user, explaining the requirements for a valid password. It also provides clear feedback to the user if their password does not meet the requirements, which can help them create a valid password without frustration.</p>

### Change screens, leave screens
```.py
# Function to log out the user
def try_logout(self):
    print("User trying logging out")
    self.parent.current = "LoginScreen"
```
The code above demonstrates how to log out a user and switch to the LoginScreen page by changing the parent's current attribute to "LoginScreen". This code structure is used in various parts of the application to enable switching between different pages.[^24]
```.kv
MDRaisedButton:
  id: return_home
  size_hint: .4, 1
  text: "Return home"
  on_press: app.root.current = "HomeScreen"
  pos_hint: {"center_x": .5, "center_y": .5}
  md_bg_color: "#689ebd"
```
The code snippet above is an example of how to create a KivyMD button and link it to a function that changes the current screen to the "HomeScreen". The function app.root.current is used to set the current screen of the app to the desired screen. This code structure is used in different parts of the app to create buttons that navigate to different screens.[^21][^24]

### Accessing result that is run in console
```.py
def search(self, query):
    result = self.cursor.execute(query).fetchall()
    return result
```
The code above demonstrates a method that allows you to retrieve the results of a query that was executed in the console. This method is helpful as it enables me to run queries and retrieve their output in various parts of my application.

### Pop-up diolog
```.py
dialog = MDDialog(title="Thank you, item deleted!",
                         text=f"Your item ID: {item_id} has been successfully deleted.")
dialog.open()
```
This code creates a dialog box using KivyMD to notify the user that an item has been successfully deleted from the database. It takes the item ID as input and displays it in the dialog box. This code is reusable in different parts of the application where a similar confirmation dialog box is needed.
